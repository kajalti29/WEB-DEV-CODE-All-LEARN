    <h1 id="heading">Mother day</h1>
    <p id="mother">A mother is the first teacher and the first friend of her children. She carries her child in her womb for nine months and nurtures her little one with all her heart and soul. She can decipher every gesture of her children since the time they are born. She loves her children unconditionally and guides them on the right path in life. She takes care of her children and ensures their safety in every way. We celebrate Mother's Day to thank our mothers, expressing our love and gratitude for them.
